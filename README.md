# Crypto Tax Calculator

A tool to calculate the capital gains of cryptocurrency assets for Canadian taxes.
The source data comes from a set of trade logs, which are provided by the exchanges.
The *adjusted cost base* (ACB) is used to calculate the capital gains.

## Disclaimer

I am not an accountant, and I do not warrant the validity of the results.
Nevertheless, I have used this program to calculate my own capital gains for tax purposes in 2017 and 2018.
In 2018, I refined the software with many new options to handle missing logs, stolen assets, and other complex issues.

## Exchanges

The following exchanges are supported:

- Binance
- Bittrex
- Kraken
- KuCoin

It is easy to add support for additional exchanges.
Simply add a parser in `trade-parse-stream.js` to convert a CSV row to the normalized format.
You can look at the existing parsers for ideas.

## Usage

Run the program with `npm start` or `node index`.
Add the `--help` option to see the available options.

Typical usage involves running the program with a set of trade logs in the form of CSV files.
For example:

```bash
node index data/*-2018.csv -odata/results-2018.md --init=\
BTC:0.73396222:12721.04,\
ETH:4.18451232:3478.97,\
LTC:11.09684:3113.88
```

There are options for providing

<sup id="options-footnote-1">[1]</sup>
A subset of the available assets can be considered for the calculation by the `--assets` option, or used to filter the results by the `--show` option.
The argument in both cases is a comma-separated list of assets.

<sup id="options-footnote-2">[2]</sup>
The balances can be carried forward from last year by the `--init` option.
The argument is a comma-separated list of assets, each with its balance and adjusted cost base, in the form of `<asset>:<balance>[:<acb>],...`, such as `--init=BTC:1:5000,ETH:5:1000,LTC:10:80`.

#### Historical data

<sup id="options-footnote-3">[3]</sup>
Historical data may be provided to the program using the `--history` option.

##### Format

The data for each currency pair must be stored in a JSON file named `<base>-<quote>.json`.
Each JSON file must contain an array of historical samples, ordered by time.
Each historical sample must contain the following fields:

| Field    | Type   | Semantics      | Description                                     |
| -------- | ------ | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `time`   | Number | UNIX timestamp | The opening time of the trading period.         |
| `open`   | Number | Currency       | The price at the opening of the trading period. |
| `close`  | Number | Currency       | The price at the closing of the trading period. |
